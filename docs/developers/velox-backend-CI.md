# Velox Backend CI

GitHub Actions (GHA) workflows are defined under `.github/workflows/`.

## Docker Build
A weekly job defined in `docker_image.yml` builds the Docker images used for CI verification. The Dockerfiles (under `dev/docker/`) and their corresponding images are listed below:

file | images | comments
-- | -- | --
Dockerfile.centos7-gcc13-static-build | apache/gluten:vcpkg-centos-7-gcc13 | centos 7, static link, jdk8
Dockerfile.centos8-gcc13-static-build | apache/gluten:vcpkg-centos-8-gcc13 | centos 8, static link, jdk8
Dockerfile.centos8-dynamic-build | apache/gluten:centos-8-jdk8 | centos 8, dynamic link, jdk8
Dockerfile.centos8-dynamic-build | apache/gluten:centos-8-jdk11 | centos 8, dynamic link, jdk11
Dockerfile.centos8-dynamic-build | apache/gluten:centos-8-jdk17 | centos 8, dynamic link, jdk17
cudf/Dockerfile.centos-9-jdk17-cuda13.1-cudf | apache/gluten:centos-9-jdk17-cuda13.1-cudf | centos 9, dynamic link, jdk17

The Docker images can be found at [https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/gluten/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/gluten/tags).

## Vcpkg Caching
The Gluten main branch is pulled during the static build in Docker, and vcpkg caches binary data for all dependencies defined under `dev/vcpkg`.
This binary data is cached into `/var/cache/vcpkg`, and CI jobs can reuse it in later builds. Setting `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES=clear` in the
environment disables reuse of the vcpkg cache.

## Arrow Libs Pre-installation
Arrow libs are pre-installed in the Docker image, since they don't change often and don't need to be rebuilt on every run.

## .M2 Cache
Dependency libraries are pre-installed into `/root/.m2` via `mvn dependency:go-offline`. Spark is set to 3.5 by default.

## Ccache
Since the Docker image is rebuilt weekly, the ccache is mostly outdated, so it is removed from the image.

## Updating the Docker Image
The GitHub secrets `DOCKERHUB_USER` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` are used to push Docker images to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/gluten/tags).
Note that GitHub secrets are not accessible in PRs from forked repos.

## Delta Spark UT
`delta_spark_ut.yml` runs delta-io/delta's own `spark` test suite against a Gluten Velox bundle, so Gluten is
validated against a real Delta release.
A number of those tests fail today.
Not because Gluten declines to offload a plan -- that should fall back to vanilla Spark and the test should
still pass.
Some are real gaps (fallback not happening where it should, metrics that differ from vanilla, native-side
bugs), and some are expected: a test that asserts on the query plan sees a different plan once the scan or
operators are offloaded, which is by design rather than a defect.
So the job does not gate on "any failure": it compares each run against a committed baseline of known failures
in `.github/workflows/util/delta-spark-ut/known-failures.txt` and fails on a **new** failure, or on a baseline
test that starts **passing** (which means the baseline needs updating).
It also fails outright if a run produced no usable results -- missing or truncated JUnit reports, or fewer
shards than expected -- rather than passing on partial data.

It runs per PR only when Delta-relevant paths change (`gluten-delta/**`, `backends-velox/src-delta*/**`, or
the pipeline's own files), nightly at 05:00 UTC for full coverage, and on demand via `workflow_dispatch` --
use the manual run to check a Velox/core change against Delta before merging.

To refresh the baseline after fixing something, run the workflow with `update_baseline=true`, download the
`delta-spark-ut-known-failures` artifact, and use the `known-failures.txt` it contains to replace
`.github/workflows/util/delta-spark-ut/known-failures.txt` in the repo.
See [.github/workflows/util/delta-spark-ut/README.md](https://github.com/apache/gluten/blob/main/.github/workflows/util/delta-spark-ut/README.md)
for the gate, the flaky-test quarantine and baseline bootstrapping.
Open follow-ups are tracked in [#12743](https://github.com/apache/gluten/issues/12743).

## Iceberg Spark UT
`iceberg_spark_ut.yml` is the Iceberg counterpart of the Delta pipeline: it runs Apache Iceberg's own `spark`
and `spark-extensions` test classes against Gluten/Velox, for Spark 3.5 + Scala 2.12 and Spark 4.0 + Scala
2.13, and gates each run against a committed baseline of known failures
(`.github/workflows/util/iceberg-spark-ut/known-failures-spark-<version>.txt`, one per target) with the same
script the Delta pipeline uses.

It needs no upstream clone and no Gluten bundle jar, because Iceberg publishes its Spark test classes as
`-tests.jar` artifacts that Gluten's `-Piceberg` profile already declares.
Surefire is pointed at those jars with `-DdependenciesToScan`, so the whole upstream suite runs (~195 test
classes per Spark version) rather than the hand-picked subset that `backends-velox/src-iceberg-spark34/`
vendors for the Spark-3.4 job in `velox_backend_x86.yml`.
Gluten is enabled without patching any upstream source: no Iceberg test sets `spark.plugins`, and Spark's
`SparkConf` picks up `spark.*` JVM system properties, so the Gluten conf is passed through surefire's
`argLine` and reaches every `SparkSession` the tests build.

It runs per PR only when Iceberg-relevant paths change (`gluten-iceberg/**`,
`backends-velox/src-iceberg*/**`, or the pipeline's own files), nightly at 07:00 UTC for full coverage, and on
demand via `workflow_dispatch` -- the manual run also chooses which Spark target(s) to test and can seed the
baseline (`update_baseline=true`, then commit the `iceberg-spark-ut-known-failures-<version>` artifact).
See [.github/workflows/util/iceberg-spark-ut/README.md](https://github.com/apache/gluten/blob/main/.github/workflows/util/iceberg-spark-ut/README.md)
for the sharding, the local repro command and baseline bootstrapping.
