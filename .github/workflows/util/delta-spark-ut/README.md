# Delta Spark UT (Gluten) — managing expected failures

Running delta-io/delta's `spark` ScalaTest suite against the Gluten Velox
bundle produces **many failures** today. Not because Gluten declines to offload
a plan -- that should fall back to vanilla Spark and the test should still pass.
Some are real gaps: fallback not happening where it should, metrics that differ
from vanilla, and native-side bugs. Others are expected rather than defects: a
test that asserts on the query plan sees a different plan once the scan or
operators are offloaded. If CI simply went red on any failure, the signal
would be useless and we could never tell a *new* breakage from the hundreds of
already-known ones.

To make this manageable we keep a **baseline of known failures** and gate each
run against it. The build is green when the only failing tests are ones already
recorded in the baseline; it goes red the moment a **previously-passing test
starts failing** (a regression).

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `known-failures.txt` | Committed baseline: the tests currently expected to fail. One `<suite>#<test>` per line. |
| `flaky-tests.txt` | Quarantine list by test name: tests whose pass/fail is non-deterministic. Ignored by the gate whether they pass or fail. `<suite-glob>#<test>` per line. |
| `flaky-error-patterns.txt` | Quarantine list by error signature: regex patterns matched against a failure's text, for bugs that surface on a different test each run (e.g. the native DV bitmap row-index error). |
| `compare-test-results.py` | Parses the JUnit XML from `sbt spark/test` and gates / seeds / aggregates against the baseline. Standard-library only. |
| `run-delta-tests.sh` | The shard step's body: runs `sbt spark/test` (tuned JVM/heap flags) under a hang watchdog, prints memory forensics, then gates the results against the baseline via `compare-test-results.py`. |
| `java-test-args.sh` | Shared JVM flags (`--add-opens` + Netty property) needed to run the suite on JDK 17 with the Gluten bundle. Sourced by `run-delta-tests.sh` and by local runs. |
| `setup-delta.sh` | Clones Delta, drops in the Gluten bundle, and patches `DeltaSQLCommandTest`. |

## How the gate works

Each test shard:

1. Runs `sbt spark/test` with ScalaTest's JUnit XML reporter enabled
   (`-u target/test-reports`), so every suite writes per-test results. (Delta
   itself only configures the console reporter, so the workflow injects this.)
2. Runs `compare-test-results.py --mode enforce`, which classifies every test:
   - **regression** — failed, but not in the baseline → **fails the shard**.
   - **expected** — failed and in the baseline → ignored.
   - **now-passing** — in the baseline but passed this run → fails the shard
     (so the baseline is kept honest), unless `fail_on_fixed=false`.
   - **quarantined** — matches an entry in `flaky-tests.txt` → always ignored,
     whether it passed or failed (see [Flaky tests](#flaky-tests) below).

A final `aggregate` job merges every shard's results into a single, sorted,
ready-to-commit `known-failures.txt` artifact and reports **stale** baseline
entries (tests no longer present in any shard, e.g. after a Delta version bump).

Tests reported as `<skipped>` are tracked separately from tests that actually
ran, so a baseline entry that was merely skipped this run is **not** mistaken
for either a fix or a stale entry: it is listed under *"Skipped this run"* and
carried over into the regenerated baseline. (Folding skips into the run set
would report them as now-passing and — under `fail_on_fixed` — demand their
removal, only for them to return as regressions the next time they execute.)

Because Delta shards **by suite**, every suite (and therefore every test) runs
in exactly one shard, so per-shard enforcement sees complete suites and never
double-counts.

## When it runs

To keep GitHub Actions usage in check, the suite does **not** run on every PR.
It lives in its own workflow (`delta_spark_ut.yml`) rather than as part of
`velox_backend_x86.yml`, so a change confined to this pipeline's own files no
longer drags in that workflow's ~50-job TPC-H/DS + Spark-UT matrix (~1750
runner-minutes per run that such a change cannot affect), and a Velox/core change
no longer carries the Delta suite.

The tradeoff: `gluten-delta/**` and `backends-velox/src-delta*/**` also match
`velox_backend_x86.yml`'s own filter (its spark-ut jobs build with `-Pdelta`), so
a change there runs **both** workflows — and because the native library is no
longer shared between them, those PRs pay for the centos-7 native build twice
(~10 min). That is the price of decoupling the two pipelines.

- **Per PR** — the workflow's own `paths:` filter runs the suite only when the PR
  touches a **high-signal Delta path**: the Delta integration code
  (`backends-velox/src-delta*`), the `gluten-delta` module, or this pipeline's
  own files (`delta_spark_ut.yml`, `util/delta-spark-ut/**`, excluding Markdown
  there — editing this README does not run the suite). GitHub evaluates the
  filter before creating the run, so an unrelated PR costs nothing at all.
  Changes to general Velox/core/native code can also affect Delta offload, but
  they're touched on most PRs, so per-PR they skip the suite — the nightly run is
  the safety net.
- **Nightly** — the **full** suite runs against the latest default branch on a
  `schedule` (05:00 UTC), so regressions from general Velox/core changes are
  still caught daily. The nightly run enforces the baseline **and** fails on
  now-passing tests (`fail_on_fixed=true`), so baseline drift surfaces as a red
  nightly — the signal to refresh `known-failures.txt`.
- **Manually** — **Actions → Delta Spark UT (Gluten) → Run workflow**
  (`workflow_dispatch`), e.g. to refresh the baseline (see below). This is also
  how you validate a Velox/core change against Delta before merging: run it on
  your branch (on your fork if you don't have write access here).

## Bootstrapping the baseline (first time)

While `known-failures.txt` has no entries the gate auto-runs in **seed mode**
(it never fails — it only records failures). To create the initial baseline:

1. Trigger **Actions → Delta Spark UT (Gluten) → Run workflow** with
   `update_baseline = true`.
2. When it finishes, download the **`delta-spark-ut-known-failures`** artifact.
3. Replace `known-failures.txt` with the file from that artifact and commit it.

From the next run onward the gate enforces the baseline.

## Day-to-day: fixing tests incrementally

- **You fixed Gluten and some Delta tests now pass.** CI will flag them as
  *now-passing*. Delete those lines from `known-failures.txt` in your PR. That
  is the whole point — the baseline only ever shrinks as coverage improves.
- **You intentionally added a new expected failure** (e.g. a test that asserts
  on a query plan that legitimately differs once Gluten offloads, or one that
  hits a tracked bug you are not fixing here). Add the exact `Suite#test`
  line(s) the gate prints under *Regressions* to `known-failures.txt`, ideally
  with a comment explaining why.
- **A genuine regression.** Fix it; do **not** add it to the baseline.

The error log prints copy-pasteable `Suite#test` lines for both regressions and
now-passing tests, and each run's job summary shows the full breakdown.

## Regenerating / refreshing the whole baseline

After a Delta version bump or a large Gluten change, regenerate from scratch the
same way as bootstrapping: run the workflow with `update_baseline=true`, download
the `delta-spark-ut-known-failures` artifact, and replace `known-failures.txt`
with the file it contains. The aggregate job
also lists **stale** entries you can prune.

The aggregate job passes `--expected-shards` (the shard count), so if a shard
dies before writing its gate lists (or its artifact fails to download) the
aggregate **fails** instead of emitting a baseline that silently omits that
shard's failures — which would otherwise shrink `known-failures.txt` and red the
next run. Re-run the workflow if this happens.

## Flaky tests

Some tests are genuinely non-deterministic (e.g. the Delta MERGE-with-deletion-vector
suites that intermittently hit a native row-index bug). Such a test would otherwise
red the gate as a **regression** when it flakes to a failure, or as **now-passing**
when it flakes to a pass — noise either way.

List these in **`flaky-tests.txt`** to **quarantine** them: the gate ignores a
quarantined test whether it passes or fails, and never writes it into the
regenerated baseline. Format is one `<suite-glob>#<test>` per line, `#`-comments
and blank lines allowed:

```
# suite portion is an fnmatch glob; test portion is matched exactly.
*DVs*Suite#matched only merge - enabled - with update and delete - isPartitioned: true
```

- The **suite** portion is an `fnmatch` glob, so `*DVs*Suite` covers every
  generated deletion-vector merge variant in one line. Use the narrowest glob
  that still covers the root-cause family.
- The **test** portion is matched **exactly** (test names are freeform and may
  contain glob metacharacters), so a same-named test in a non-matching suite is
  still gated normally.

### Quarantine by error signature

Some bugs surface on a **different test each run** — for example the native Delta
DV bitmap row-index error (the aggregator gets a garbage row index during a MERGE
that writes deletion vectors and aborts, e.g. `Delta RoaringBitmapArray row index
... exceeds max representable value` or `Delta bitmap row index cannot be
negative: ...`) lands on a different `*DVs*Suite` MERGE test every time. Chasing
those by name is whack-a-mole, so quarantine them by **root cause** in
**`flaky-error-patterns.txt`** instead: each line is a regex matched against a
failed test's `<failure>`/`<error>` text. Any failure that matches is treated as
flaky regardless of which test it hit (and is dropped from the shard's failures
list so it can't leak into the baseline):

```
# regex matched against the failure message + stack (enforce mode).
# one explicit pattern per known error, deliberately specific.
Delta RoaringBitmapArray row index \d+ exceeds max representable value
Delta bitmap row index cannot be negative: -?\d+
```

This is more precise than a name glob: a *different* real failure in the same
suite is still caught, because only failures carrying the signature are ignored.

Quarantining (either kind) is an **interim** measure — it hides a real bug from
CI. Each entry should reference the tracking issue, and be removed once the
underlying bug is fixed so the test is enforced again.

## Caveats

- **Known failures still execute** (and fail) — they are gated *after* the run,
  not skipped — so they still consume CI time. This keeps us decoupled from
  Delta's sources; skipping them at runtime would require patching Delta.

## Running the comparison locally

```bash
# after an sbt spark/test run that wrote delta/**/target/test-reports/*.xml
python3 .github/workflows/util/delta-spark-ut/compare-test-results.py \
  --mode enforce \
  --reports-dir delta \
  --known-failures .github/workflows/util/delta-spark-ut/known-failures.txt \
  --flaky-tests .github/workflows/util/delta-spark-ut/flaky-tests.txt \
  --failures-out /tmp/failures.txt --ran-out /tmp/ran.txt
```

## Running the suite locally

`sbt spark/test` needs extra JDK-17 JVM flags to run the Delta suite against the
Gluten bundle (`--add-opens` + the Netty reflection property). CI and local runs
share one definition in `java-test-args.sh` — `source` it before invoking sbt so
the flags reach the sbt launcher and the forked test JVM:

```bash
# from the Delta clone prepared by setup-delta.sh (which has the Gluten bundle):
source <gluten>/.github/workflows/util/delta-spark-ut/java-test-args.sh
./build/sbt "++ 2.13.16" spark/test        # or a single suite via testOnly
```

`run-delta-tests.sh` sources the same file, so CI and local runs use identical
flags.
