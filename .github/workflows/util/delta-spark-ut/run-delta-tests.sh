# Runs the Delta `spark` module tests for one shard under the Gluten bundle:
# arms a hang watchdog (thread-dumps + kills a wedged fork), invokes sbt
# spark/test with the tuned JVM/heap flags, prints cgroup memory forensics, and
# then gates the results against the baseline (compare-test-results.py). Extracted
# from delta_spark_ut.yml so the workflow step stays readable.
#
# Driven by environment (set by the workflow step / job):
#   SHARD_ID          - this shard's id (matrix.shard)
#   SPARK_VERSION     - Delta -DsparkVersion value
#   UPDATE_BASELINE   - 'true' -> gate seed mode; else enforce
#   FAIL_ON_FIXED     - passed through to the gate
#   DELTA_SCALA_VERSION, NUM_SHARDS, TEST_PARALLELISM_COUNT, DELTA_TESTING
#                     - test env (see the workflow step's `env:` block)
#   GITHUB_WORKSPACE  - repo root (holds the Delta clone + util scripts)
#
# JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS is set by sourcing java-test-args.sh (below), not the caller.

#
# JVM heap layout -- two memory consumers on the ~16G runner:
# * sbt launcher JVM: -J-Xmx4G for the test compile, then forced to
#   return idle memory during the (long) test phase via G1 periodic GC
#   (G1PeriodicGCInterval=10s; G1PeriodicGCSystemLoadThreshold=0 so the
#   busy fork doesn't suppress it; -XX:-G1PeriodicGCInvokesConcurrent
#   forces each periodic GC to a full STW collection) that uncommits to a
#   tight free ratio (Min/MaxHeapFreeRatio 5/15, JEP 346) above a low
#   -Xms512m floor.
#   Without this the idle launcher holds ~5.3G for the whole run; with
#   it, it drops back to ~1-2G. These flags touch no Gluten/Spark runtime
#   config, so they cannot affect the measured pass/fail signal.
# * Forked test JVM: -Xmx2G via the `set ... Test / javaOptions` command
#   below. Delta caps its fork at -Xmx1024m in build.sbt; `++=` appends
#   so our -Xmx2G comes last and wins. Gluten offloads data to Velox
#   off-heap (capped at 2g via spark.memory.offHeap.size in the patched
#   DeltaSQLCommandTest), so the fork's heap need is modest. A larger
#   fork heap pushed the cgroup peak past the ~16G OOM threshold and the
#   kernel OOM-killed the fork mid-shard (no hs_err), wedging sbt -- 2G
#   keeps headroom. Keep heap-dump-on-OOM so a real >2G heap OOM is
#   analyzable.
# `-u target/test-reports` enables ScalaTest's JUnit XML reporter so
# every suite writes per-test results. Delta itself only configures
# the console reporter (-oDF), so without this we'd have no machine-
# readable results to gate on. The path is relative to the forked
# test JVM's working dir (Test / baseDirectory = spark/), i.e.
# delta/spark/target/test-reports/TEST-*.xml.
#
# We deliberately do NOT let an sbt non-zero exit (which fires on the
# MANY expected Delta-on-Gluten failures) fail this step directly.
# Instead the known-failures gate below decides pass/fail: the build
# is green when the only failures are ones already recorded in the
# baseline, and red on a genuine regression.
set +e
# --- hang watchdog ---------------------------------------------------
# Shard 2 (and occasionally others) hangs indefinitely after a suite's
# last test with no further output. ScalaTest's failAfter only wraps
# individual test BODIES, so a wedge in suite teardown/afterAll -- or in
# a non-interruptible native Velox/JNI call that ignores
# Thread.interrupt() -- has no timeout and stalls until the 350-min job
# limit with zero diagnostics. This watchdog dumps the forked test JVM's
# threads (to the job log, and to a file for the artifact) once the test
# output has been silent for too long, so the deadlock is diagnosable.
SBT_LOG="/tmp/sbt-spark-test-shard-${SHARD_ID}.log"
# Marker the watchdog touches when it KILLS a wedged test fork. The killed fork's
# running suite plus every suite queued behind it never run and never write a
# report, and since we ignore sbt's exit code the gate would only judge the
# suites that DID report -- so the main flow fails the shard when this exists.
WATCHDOG_KILL_MARKER="/tmp/sbt-watchdog-killed-shard-${SHARD_ID}"
# Marker the main flow touches when sbt returns, to stop this shard's watchdog.
# Shard-scoped like the log and kill marker above: shards get their own container
# in CI, but a shared /tmp (parallel local runs) would otherwise let the first
