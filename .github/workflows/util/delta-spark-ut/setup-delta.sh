#
# Arguments:
#   delta_ref           - git ref (tag/branch/sha) to check out (e.g. v4.2.0)
#   delta_dir           - destination directory for the Delta clone
#   gluten_bundle_jar   - path to the gluten-velox-bundle fat jar
#   gluten_repo_root    - path to the Gluten repository root (used to locate
#                         backends-velox/src-delta40/.../DeltaSQLCommandTest.scala)

# The Gluten bundle jar must be on the spark project's TEST runtime classpath
# (so DeltaSQLCommandTest can load org.apache.gluten.GlutenPlugin by name) but
# NOT on the COMPILE classpath of `sparkV1`, which is the project that holds
# Delta's main sources. The bundle's transitive contents include extra symbols
# under `org.apache.spark.sql` that collide with Delta's main sources -- e.g.
# MergeOutputGeneration.scala imports both `org.apache.spark.sql._` and
# `org.apache.spark.sql.delta.ClassicColumnConversions._`, and would then fail
# with `reference to expression is ambiguous`.
#
# sbt auto-scans `<baseDirectory>/lib` via `unmanagedBase`. Two relevant
# projects in Delta v4.2.0 have a `lib/` baseDirectory:
#   - sparkV1: `project in file("spark")`     -> spark/lib
#   - spark  : `project in file("spark-unified")` -> spark-unified/lib
# unmanagedJars are project-scoped (NOT inherited by dependents), so dropping
# the bundle into spark-unified/lib/ adds it to the unified `spark` project's
# Compile *and* Test classpaths -- but NOT to sparkV1's. That's exactly what
# we want:
#   * sparkV1/Compile sees ONLY Delta's regular deps -> Delta main compiles.
#   * spark/Test/fullClasspath sees the bundle -> tests load GlutenPlugin.
# (Verified empirically: with bundle only in spark-unified/lib/, sbt's
#  `show sparkV1/Compile/dependencyClasspath` excludes the bundle and
#  `show spark/Test/fullClasspath` includes it.)
#
# We deliberately do NOT also drop the bundle into spark/lib/, which is what
# caused the previous compile failure: spark/lib/ is sparkV1's unmanagedBase,
# and putting the bundle there would re-introduce the ambiguity errors.

# (`scala.MatchError: List()`, empty partition filters, broken column-pruning /

# Gluten scans implement (behavior-preserving for vanilla). Both are merged
