"""Gate / seed / aggregate the Delta-on-Gluten unit test results.

Running delta-io/delta's ScalaTest suite against the Gluten Velox bundle
produces many *expected* failures (Gluten does not yet support every Delta
code path). To keep the red/green signal meaningful while we fix those
failures incrementally, we maintain a committed baseline of known failing
tests (``known-failures.txt``) and compare each CI run against it.

This script has three modes:

``enforce`` (default, per shard)
    Parse the JUnit XML produced by ``sbt spark/test`` (ScalaTest ``-u``
    reporter) and compare against the baseline:

      * regression -- a test that FAILED but is NOT in the baseline. These
        fail the build: a previously-passing test just started failing.
      * expected   -- a test that failed and IS in the baseline. Ignored.
      * fixed      -- a baseline test that now PASSES. By default these also
        fail the build (``--fail-on-fixed true``) so the baseline stays honest
        and contributors remove entries as they fix them.

    If the baseline file exists but is empty (not yet bootstrapped) the mode
    automatically degrades to ``seed`` so the first run is never spuriously red.
    A *missing* ``--known-failures`` file is treated as a configuration error
    (the gate fails) so a mis-referenced path can't silently pass.

``seed`` (bootstrap / ``update_baseline``)
    Never fails. Just writes the current shard's failing tests so the baseline
    can be (re)generated from a real run.

``aggregate`` (final job)
    Merge every shard's ``--failures-out`` / ``--ran-out`` / ``--skipped-out``
    file into a single, sorted, ready-to-commit ``known-failures.txt`` and report
    stale baseline entries (tests no longer present in any shard). Skipped tests
    are tracked apart from run tests so "stale" means *truly absent* rather than
    merely skipped this run; they are also kept out of the now-passing set, since
    a skipped test is not evidence of a fix. Pass ``--expected-shards N``
    to fail when fewer than ``N`` shards contributed gate lists (a shard that
    died before writing them), so an incomplete baseline is never produced.

Flaky quarantine (``--flaky-tests``)
    Some Delta-on-Gluten failures are non-deterministic (e.g. a native bug that
    only triggers on certain runtime plans), so they are neither a stable pass
    nor a stable failure and cannot live in the baseline: baselining them turns
    the gate red on every run where they pass, and leaving them out turns it red
    on every run where they fail. ``flaky-tests.txt`` quarantines them -- a
    quarantined test never counts as a regression (when it fails) nor as
    now-passing (when it passes), and is excluded from the regenerated baseline.
    Its SUITE is an fnmatch glob (so one line covers a root-cause family across
    generated suite variants); its TEST name is matched exactly.

Flaky quarantine by error signature (``--flaky-error-patterns``)
    When a failure is caused by a known nondeterministic bug that surfaces on a
    *different test each run* (e.g. the native Delta DV bitmap row-index error),
    matching by test name is whack-a-mole. ``flaky-error-patterns.txt`` instead
    quarantines by root cause: each line is a regex matched against a failed
    test's <failure>/<error> text, and any failure that matches is treated as
    flaky regardless of which test it landed on.

Baseline file format (``known-failures.txt``)::

    # comment lines start with '#'
    <fully.qualified.SuiteName>#<test display name>

The suite is always a JVM class name (dot-separated, never starts with '#'),
so a line whose first non-space character is '#' is unambiguously a comment,
and the FIRST '#' after the suite separates suite from the (possibly
'#'-containing) test name.

Only the Python standard library is used so the script runs in the bare
centos image used by the Delta UT pipeline with no ``pip install``.
