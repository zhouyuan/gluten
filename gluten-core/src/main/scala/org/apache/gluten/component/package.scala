   * Only the graph and the latch are reset. Values derived from an earlier [[Component.sorted]] are
   * not: `BackendsApiManager.backend`, `GlutenCostModel.costModelRegistry` and the `graphCache`
   * inside `Transition.factory` keep what they computed from the pre-clear component set. Neither
   * are the per-vertex `TransitionGraph.Vertex.initialized` flags, so a re-registered component
   * does not add its transition edges a second time. Rediscovery also constructs fresh component
   * instances, so such a value can end up holding an instance that is no longer the one in the
   * graph.
   *
   * Visible for testing. The graph and the latch are both JVM-global, so a suite that registers
   * components of its own leaks them into every later suite in the same JVM. Such a suite must call
   * this when it finishes.
